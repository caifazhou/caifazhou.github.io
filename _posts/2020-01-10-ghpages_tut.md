title: How to personal page using Jekyll?
published: True
---

This is the very first blog that I am planning to write. It is about how I setup this personal page using `Jekyll`, which I have forked from [`jekyll-now`](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Frankly speaking, I am a newbee about webpage and I have no experience about `HTML`. What I am going to note down in this blog is about how I modify the template in order to make it fit more to my personal style.

## Structure
- The main page is defined in `index.md` (or `index.html`)[^1]





[^1]: In `Github-pages`, `.html` and `.md` can be used interchangablly.
